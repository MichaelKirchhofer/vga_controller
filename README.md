#5th Semester CHIP Design 2 VGA Controller Project

Implemented a VGA Controller for 640x480 monitor display. It displays contents generated by two pattern generators (1. for horizontal stripes and 2. 
for a checkerboard), as well as a picture given by a ROM Memory. It can also display a smaller, also ROM read image and display its contents over the three
other image sources.
